### Purpose

The modern streaming landscape often leaves users feeling lost and confused as to what to watch next. There is so much content to watch it is often paralysing, and it is hard to know what is worthwhile. **Kinogo** can help people find something worth watching fast, so you spend less time flicking and more time enjoying.

### User Stories

#### User personas

User Personas, alongside User Stories, are really useful in providing the direction for what features need to be built during the development process. As a part of the Agile methodology, these frameworks help guide and give a clear direction to the development team, based on the various end user’s needs. This is different to buildings features based on technical requirements which would ultimately lead to building a product that no one uses.

In order for us to help narrow down what features we were going to build for Kinogo, we decided to create two user personas that we felt represented a reasonable cross-section of our user base. While we didn’t have time to interview users one on one, we felt that these two personas provided us with enough of a foundation to create our user stories. We used a template described [here](https://www.hotjar.com/blog/user-personas/) as a basis for creating our User personas.

**Our Personas:**

---

_The Cinephile_

---

_Who are they?_

The Cinephile loves to be up to date with all the latest cinematic releases, whether they be the latest superhero action film to the most obscure Arthouse feature. They are passionate about films and even more passionate about critiquing them. They are also the go to person for film recommendations in their immediate circle.

_What is their main goal?_

Their main goal is to compile a list of the films they have seen as well as the critiques they’ve made about them.

_What’s the main barrier to achieving this goal?_

Having a centralised website that incorporates all the tools they need to compile their movie watchlist and reviews

---

_The Casual_

---

_Who are they?_

The Casual enjoys watching movies when they have the time. While they enjoy watching films, they are only aware of the latest releases when they see a billboard or an advertisement on television. While they don’t dissect films from back to front, they like to make sure that ones they do watch are worth watching.

_What is their main goal?_

To find the latest releases when they decide to go and watch a film.

_What’s the main barrier to achieving this goal?_

They don’t have a place that tells them what the latest films are.

#### User Stories

Once we were able to work out what features were best for our users through the personas we set about creating some user stories. First, we created some epics to encompass the features at a high level. Each epic has stories attached to them that break down the tasks required to implement the required functionality. each story has some Acceptance Criteria influenced by the personas, to make sure that there is a need for what we are building. Here is an example of a few of our Epics:
